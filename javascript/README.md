# JavaScript Foundations

This folder documents my systematic study of JavaScript using the **official [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)**.  
Each section includes runnable code examples and concise explanations written in my own words.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in JavaScript’s core mechanisms before moving on to frameworks and TypeScript.

## 02. Intermediate

### Focus  
Deepening understanding of JavaScript internals and language design.

### Coverage
1. Language Overview  
2. JavaScript Data Structures  
3. Equality Comparisons and Sameness  
4. Enumerability and Ownership of Properties  
5. Closures (detailed exploration and common use cases)

---

## 03. Advanced

### Focus  
Mastering JavaScript’s low-level mechanisms and performance considerations.

### Coverage
1. Inheritance and the Prototype Chain  
2. Meta Programming (Proxy, Reflect, Symbols)  
3. Memory Management and Garbage Collection

## Study Approach

- Each topic is explored through both documentation-based reading and hands-on examples.  
- Code snippets are tested directly in Node.js or browser environments.  
- Commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for clarity.  

**Example:**
- feat(functions): demonstrate closure and lexical scope
- fix(objects): correct prototype assignment
- docs(promises): summarize chaining and error handling

## Objective

1. Develop an intuitive understanding of how JavaScript executes.  
2. Build clean, maintainable code from core principles.  
3. Prepare for transition into TypeScript and front-end frameworks with confidence.
